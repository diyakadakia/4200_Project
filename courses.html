        The visualization provides an overview of the effect of curricular units and how well each course is being taught. The heatmap shows 
        the evaluation status of different curricular units, with the colors indicating the approved rate, evaluation rate, and no evaluation 
        rate. There are some units that are "Approved" while others with "No Evaluation" rates. The visualization highlights the importance of
        regularly assessing the effectiveness of educational programs offered.

    <h1 class="header">Effect of Courses on Grades and Dropout Rates</h1>

        These visualizations compare the grade distributions for two user-selected courses, which could be useful for instructors or administrators to 
        identify potential areas for improvement or support based on the differences in grade distributions between the courses. For example, there are notable differences 
        beteween Tourism and Nursing. For Tourism, the grades are more spread out, with a higher number of students achieving grades in the 9-15 range and a significant 
        dropout population, particularly for grades below 13. In contrast, the grade distribution for Nursing is more concentrated in the higher grade ranges, with the majority 
        of students achieving grades of 14 or above and its dropout population is smaller compared to Tourism.

        The visualization demonstrates the average grades by dropout status (dropout, graduate, enrolled) for various courses. A consistent pattern is shown across 
        most courses - graduated students tend to have the highest median grades, followed by enrolled students, and then dropouts. This suggests a strong correlation between 
        student academic performance and their eventual dropout status, with higher achieving students being more likely to graduate. Courses like Advertising and 
        Marketing Management, Agronomy, Animation and Multimedia Design, and Basic Education exemplify this trend. While there are a few exceptions, such as Veterinary 
        Nursing where dropouts have a range similar to graduate students and median similar to enrolled students, the overall data indicates that institutions could 
        potentially identify at-risk students by reguarly checking student progress and should implement targeted interventions to improve retention rates by focusing on 
        factors that influence academic performance.
