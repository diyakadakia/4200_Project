        The visualization provides an overview of the effect of curricular units and how well each course is being taught. The heatmap shows the evaluation status of different curricular units, with the colors indicating the approved rate, evaluation rate, and no evaluation rate. There are some units that are "Approved" while others with "No Evaluation" rates. The visualization highlights the importance of regularly assessing the effectiveness of educational programs offered.

    <h1 class = "header">Effect of Courses on Grades and Dropout Rates</h1>

        These visualizations compare the grade distributions for several different courses from which you can choose from, Course 1 and Course 2. The dropdown menus allow the user to select the specific courses they want to analyze, which could be useful for instructors or administrators to identify potential areas for improvement or support based on the differences in grade distributions between the courses. For Course 1 ‘Tourism”, the grades are more spread out, with a higher number of students achieving grades in the 9-15 range and a significant dropout population, particularly for grades below 13. In contrast, the grade distribution for Course 2. “Nursing” is more concentrated in the higher grade ranges, with the majority of students achieving grades of 14 or above. The dropout population is smaller compared to Tourism.

        The visualization demonstrates the average grades by dropout status (dropout, graduate, enrolled) for various courses. A consistent pattern is shown across most courses - enrolled students tend to have the highest average grades, followed by graduates, and then dropouts. This suggests a strong correlation between student academic performance and their eventual dropout status, with higher achieving students being more likely to graduate. Courses like Advertising and Marketing Management, Agronomy, Animation and Multimedia Design, and Basic Education exemplify this trend. While there are a few exceptions, such as Journalism and Communication, the overall data indicates that institutions could potentially identify at-risk students and implement targeted interventions to improve retention rates by focusing on factors that influence academic performance.
