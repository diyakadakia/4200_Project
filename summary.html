    <h1 class="header">Conclusions</h1>

    <p class="text" id='main'> 
        Analyzing the factors that influence student drop-out and success rates is essential for implementing preventive measures and ensuring every
        student's success. Our analysis examines the relationship between  academic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors and student success rates. 
        Academic performance plays a key role, with better evaluations of curricular programs linked to lower dropout rates. This shows the importance
        of regularly improving educational programs and reviewing students' individual academic performance to help students stay on track.
        Demographic factors like gender and marital status also impact dropout rates. Data suggests that certain gender groups face
        higher dropout rates and marital status can also affect academic performance and dropout decisions, which highlights the need for targeted support 
        to address the challenges these groups may experience. Socioeconomic conditions, such unemployment rates and economic stability, are also closely 
        tied to student outcomes. Students from areas with higher unemployment or lower GDP tend to have higher dropout rates.
        These findings point to the need for schools to implement intiatives that support students academically, accomodate the challenges different groups face, 
        and address external factors like economic stability to help students succeed.

    <h1 class="header">Future Plans</h1>

    <p class="text" id='main'> 
        In the future, we would like to develop a machine learning algorithim to determine if students will drop out or graduate on time. 
        This will also educators to get personalized insights on each student. They can develop tools that provide customized recommendations for students
        based on their academic performance, socioeconomic background, and personal needs. We also aim to place greater emphasis on location to gain a more
        global understanding of the issue. We would like to determine if the trends are consistent across different regions of the world.
