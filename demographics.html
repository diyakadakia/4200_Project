        This visualization examines the effect of gender and marital status on student dropout rates. The top left chart shows a wide range of outcomes across different qualification levels, while the charts on the right provide more detailed insights. The "Dropout Status by Gender" chart indicates that female students have higher dropout rates compared to male students. The "Dropout Status by Marital Status" chart further reveals that single and widowed students have significantly higher dropout rates than married or legally separated students. These findings suggest that both gender and marital status can be important factors influencing student outcomes, and institutions may need to consider targeted support and interventions to address the unique challenges faced by specific demographic groups in order to improve overall retention and completion rates.
