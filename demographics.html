        This visualization examines the effect of gender and marital status on student dropout rates. The scatterplot shows a wide range 
        of outcomes across different qualification levels, but shows a positive correlation between admission grade and previous 
        qualificaton (higher previous qualification grades are associated with higher admission grades). The bar charts below 
        provide more detailed insights regarding gender and marital status. The "Dropout Status by Gender" chart indicates that while there 
        are more female students and a similar number of male and female students dropped out, there is a higher proportion of males who dropped out. 
        The "Dropout Status by Marital Status" chart further reveals that there are significantly more single students in the data and have a higher proportion of
        dropouts than married or divorced students. When examining the lower range of students (previous qualification score around 100), there is still
        a higher proportion of males who dropped out, but the students are married, single, or divorced. Alternatively, when examining the higher range of students 
        (previous qualification greater than or equal to 175), there is still a higher proportion of male dropouts, but the students
        are single or in a de facto union. This could be because married and divorced students might have other commitments, such as taking care of one's family/children, 
        while students who are single or in a de facto union might be younger and have more time and energy to dedicate to their studies. 
        These findings suggest that both gender and marital status can be important factors influencing student outcomes, and institutions 
        may need to consider targeted support and interventions to address the unique challenges faced by specific demographic groups in 
        order to improve overall retention and completion rates.
