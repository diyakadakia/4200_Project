        This visualization depicts the influence of unemployment rate and GDP on dropout rate. The scatter plot indicates that as the unemployment rate increases and GDP decreases, the dropout rate tends to rise, with higher dropout rates concentrated in the lower right quadrant where unemployment is high and GDP is low, and lower dropout rates seen in the upper left where unemployment is lower and GDP is higher. This suggests that economic factors like unemployment and GDP have a significant impact on student dropout rates, highlighting the importance of addressing broader socioeconomic conditions to improve educational outcomes.
