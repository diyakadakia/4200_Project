    <p class="text" id='main'> 
        Examining the key factors that influence student retention and academic success is vital for improving educational outcomes. Student dropout in higher education 
        remains a significant challenge, with far-reaching effects on individuals, society, and the economy. By exploring underlying causes such as financial constraints,
        academic struggles, personal circumstances, and institutional practices, schools can create more effective strategies to support students and prevent attrition.
        This project aims to identify patterns and factors that influence both student achievement and dropout decisions by analyzing data from a variety of student
        demographics and academic settings. The findings will offer crucial insights to help shape policies that foster inclusive, supportive, and equitable learning 
        environments.

        The first reference paper that relates to our topic of factors influencing student drop-out and success rates is <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1165463">“The Reasons of School Dropouts in Higher Education: Babaeski Vocational College Case”</a>.
        This paper explores the circumstances of students at Kirklareli University Babaeski Vocational College that requested to drop out, the various types of dropouts (temporary, permanently leaving the university, 
        and permanently abandoning education), the significance of understanding factors that lead to these dropout cases. They analyzed various reasons for dropping out, from economic to familial to health to military service, 
        and how personal factors might influence these reasons, such as gender, major, and class timings (Can et al 84-88). This is related to our topic since our dataset also aims to understand how gender, major, finances,
        and class timings might influence drop-out decisions. This paper is based on a case study in a Turkish university, so it might provide more context and insights on the European education system since our dataset is collected 
        from a Portuguese institution.

        Another reference paper that is linked to our topic is <a href="https://www.dccc.edu/sites/default/files/about/faculty-staff/innovation-teaching-digital-learning/innovationteachingdigitallearningjournalvol1.pdf">“Where Have All the Students Gone? Why College Students Drop Out”</a> 
        by William Clifton from The Journal of Innovation, Teaching, and Digital Learning Excellence. His article explains that drop-out and graduation rates are abnormal with 45% of students not graduating within four years, and the primary reasons driving these drop-out and graduation statistics. Dr. Clifton provides 
        a quantitative analysis to support his argument that there are financial, academic, and personal factors that cause students to drop-out, including financial constraints, family demands, demands from part/full-time jobs, 
        credit loads per semester, and academic fit (Clifton 2-5). This relates to our project since we aim to explore the significance/impact of similar factors, including debt and credit loads, in the decision to drop out of a 
        college program.
